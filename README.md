A small Python 3 script I made to download movies from KickassTorrents easily. Checking an email address, it will use the subject line of unread emails to search KAT and download it with transmission-remote. I'm currently using it on an old MacBook converted into a Linux server.

## Installation

Download the EasyMovie folder.

## Usage

Run EasyMovie.py, and go through the initial setup. The settings will be saved throughout runs. Send an email from a specified user to your specified gmail account with the requested movie name in the subject line, and an email will be sent back to all of the users with the downloaded movie name and the transmission-remote output.
