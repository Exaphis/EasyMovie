A small Python 3 script I made to download movies from KickassTorrents easily. Checking an email address, it will use the subject line of unread emails to search KAT and download it with transmission-remote. I'm currently using it on an old MacBook converted into a Linux server.

## Installation

Download the EasyMovie folder, and run EasyMovie.py with Python 3.
